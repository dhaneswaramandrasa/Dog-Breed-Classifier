# Project Motivation

The project is aiming to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
